  ## Installation
  Fork my repository and run npm init to install node, then you can run with node index.js.
  ## Usage
  Make sure you have installed all the dependencies. When you are prompted with questions answer them and insure you Github username is correct. Then the readme should generate and you can push it up to your repo.
